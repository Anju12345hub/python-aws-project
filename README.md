# python-aws-project
In this AWS-Python project, we are developing a system that automates EBS volume management using AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudWatch Events. Whenever a new EBS volume is created, it will trigger the lambda function. We utilize CloudWatch Events to monitor the created EBS volumes, specifically targeting those of type gp2. When such a volume is detected, the system will automatically convert it to type gp3, optimizing storage performance. This project aims to demonstrate how serverless functions and event-driven mechanism can be used to enhance EBS volume management on AWS
